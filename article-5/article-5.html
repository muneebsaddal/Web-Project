		  <p>Tesla is halting Model 3 production yet again to try to tackle problems along the assembly line, it has emerged.</p>
		  <p>Starting today, Tesla is stopping the line for up to five days to remedy the problems that are still keeping production at a relative snail’s pace. It comes just a couple of weeks after the line hit a 2000-car weekly output for the first time.</p>

		  <p>Tesla still wants to be building 5000 cars every week by the end of June, and rates the latest factory halt as essential to achieving that. Workers, who were recently offered overtime to help ramp-up Model 3 build rates, will stay at home without pay or use paid holiday. A small number have been retained in the Fremont building on other work.</p>
		  <p>This news will not help Tesla’s rumoured cash-burning status, or do much to ease the criticism over shoddy build quality. Perhaps this time the engineers will finally get it right… or perhaps not. It surely has to happen eventually.</p>
