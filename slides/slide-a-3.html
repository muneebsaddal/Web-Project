		  <p>People have been talking about the Koenigsegg One:1 for about a year now, but until now, we had no official details on the upcoming hypercar. In a recent interview with Business Week, Christian von Koenigsegg offered the first unofficial numbers on Koenigsegg’s upcoming halo car.</p>
		  <p>Koenigsegg named the next hypercar "One:1" because Koenigsegg hopes it to be the first model to achieve a one-to-one ratio of weight and horsepower: 1,400 kg (3,086 pounds) and 1,400 horsepower.</p>
		  <p>As you likely expected, these numbers will help it deliver incredible performance figures. According to von Koenigsegg, the One:1 will be the fastest Koenigsegg yet, with an estimated top speed of 450 km/h (279.6 mph). If this becomes a reality, the One:1 would also smash the much-disputed current world record held by Bugatti Veyron Super Sport of 268 mph.</p>
		  <p>Next to this incredible top speed, the One:1 will also be the fastest car in the world from 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph), from 0 to 300 km/h (186 mph) and from 0 to 400 (248.5 mph). Koenigsegg expects the One:1 to hit 400 km/h (248.5 mph) in just 20 seconds. To put that into perspective, the Bugatti Veyron needs a "pedestrian" 45 seconds to hit the same speed.</p>
		  <p>Koenigsegg hopes to offer a prototype version by the end of the year, and like the Veyron, he expects to lose money with each model sold.</p>

		  <p>The first details on the Koenigsegg One:1 appeared on the internet back in 2012, when some strange renderings surfaced online. Initially it was rumored that the One:1 would be a one-off edition specially developed for a very rich Chinese client.</p>
		  <p>We later learned that those rumors were not true, and that the "One:1" name was referring to the supercar’s intended one-to-one power to weight ratio. The supercar will be powered by a modified version of the Agera’s 5.0-liter, V-8 engine with a rumored output of 1,400 horsepower.</p>
