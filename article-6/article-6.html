		  <p>If the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon just isn’t as serious as you’d like, don’t worry: Ford has something far more extreme up its sleeve. It’s the 50th anniversary Mustang Cobra Jet, and it’s going to be rather brisk.</p>
		  <p>It’s lurking somewhere in the shadows of this teaser image, and Ford has already let slip a few tantalising details about the 2018 Mustang-based machine, ahead of full specs being revealed this summer. Most importantly, it’ll be capable of dispatching a standing quarter-mile in the “mid-8-second range,” crossing the line at over 150mph. Cripes.</p>

		  <p>This will be possible thanks to a supercharged version of Ford’s Coyote V8 5.2-litre V8, which will be fitted to the drag strip-ready Mustang along with new four-link suspension and a beefy solid rear axle. It’ll come with all the necessary safety gear too, including an NHRA-approved roll cage and FIA spec racing seats.</p>
		  <p>As with previous Cobra Jets, production will be limited: just 68 cars are set to be built.</p>
