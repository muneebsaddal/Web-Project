      <p>The purpose of this website is to gather all the car lovers in Pakistan to a particular platform, in order to satisfy their love for the cars and to thrill away with the latest modified cars. We felt a need of such a platform as both of the team members are a major car enthusiastic but unfortunately we were not able to find such a site in order to satisfy our craze for the cars</p>
		
      <p> A person in Pakistan in order to get a perfect car would have to visit multiple sites, one for buying the car, other for getting the accessories, other for selling the older one, other for getting the reviews about the car and yet another to get latest news about the cars, so we basically combined all the platforms to one place in order to satisfy the need of a car lover. </p>
		
      <p>Our motivation was to create ease for the people of Pakistan in order to get a perfect ride for themselves or for the family. A perfect site to remove any query about the cars through our social page. </p>
		
      <p>We are basically creating an e commerce web site, along with a social site and a news website side by side. For the news section we will be getting all the latest news from the well reputed websites on the internet updating the news page every hour. We are basically planning to divide our website to 3 major sections:</p>
  	  <ol>
		  <li>News</li>
		  <li>Shop</li>
		</ol>
