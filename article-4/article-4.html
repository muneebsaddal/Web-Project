	      <h2>The New M4-Engined BMW M2 Competition Has Killed Off The Standard Car</h2>
	    </section>
    <section class="tagline">
      <h4>BMW's new M2 packs an 'S55' twin-turbo straight-six and an appetite for RS Audi TTs</h4>
    </section>

		<section class="article-text">
		  <p>Following last week’s leak, BMW’s M2 Competition has gone official. And my word, do we want one. </p>
		  <p>As suspected for some time - and as good as confirmed by the leaked info last week - under the M2 Comp’s bonnet you’ll find an engine “based on the power unit from the BMW M3/M4.” It’s slightly less powerful at 404bhp, but with 404lb ft of twist on tap, it has the same torque figure as its two big brothers. </p>

	  <section class="article-text">
		  <p>A sizeable jump from the M2’s 364bhp and 369lb ft figures, and the extra thrust allows for a 0-62mph time of 4.2 seconds in the DCT-equipped version - 0.2sec quicker than the standard car. The manual meanwhile will do the same in 4.4 seconds. </p>
		  <p>Again, nothing we didn’t already know thanks to last week’s - ahem - early reveal, but here’s a new detail for you: the M2 Competition actually replaces the standard car. And we can see why - who’d want the boggo N55-engined version now? </p>

	  <section class="article-text">
		  <p>Sitting above the S55 you’ll find something else pinched from the M3/M4 parts bin: a carbonfibre reinforced plastic strut brace. The electric power steering has been recalibrated to complement the front end’s increase in stiffness. </p>
		  <p>In terms of aesthetics, we have a reshaped bumper at the front plus enlarged, gloss black kidney grilles, new ‘double-arm’ aero-friendly wing mirrors and repositioned quad tailpipes at the back. Oh, and a nice black ‘M2 Competition’ badge on the boot lid to finish things off.</p>

	  <section class="article-text">
		  <p>The 19-inch wheels are new too, although there are forged rims of the same size available as an option. Beefier M Sport six-piston front/four-piston rear brakes are on the menu too, if you fancy them. </p>
		  <p>Expecting a huge price rise for all the changes? Allow us to deliver a pleasant surprise: the manual version is £49,285, about £2500 more than the car it replaces. The automatic meanwhile is £51,930, which is still cheaper than the Audi TT RS. </p>
		  <p>The first UK-spec cars will be landing this August. </p>
